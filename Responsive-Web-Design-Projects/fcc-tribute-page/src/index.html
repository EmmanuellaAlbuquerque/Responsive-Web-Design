      <h3>Timeline from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/jul/21/spaceexploration.science1" target="_blank" id="tribute-timeline">The Guardian&trade;</a></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Born in Oxford, England</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1953 to 1958</strong> - Attends St Albans school in North London,
          where he develops a passion for mathematics. His father wants him to study
          medicine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1959 to 1962</strong> - Specialises in physics at University College
          Oxford. Graduates with a first class degree in natural sciences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1963</strong> - Begins research in cosmology and general relativity
          at the University of Cambridge. He is diagnosed with an "incurable disease"
          at the age of 21, which is later found to be Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,
          a rare progressive disease that effects movement and speech. He continues
          with his research.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1966</strong> - Completes his doctorate and is awarded a fellowship
          at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He works on singularities in the
          theory of general relativity and applies his ideas to the study of black
          holes. Collaborates with mathematician Roger Penrose, who was working at
          Birkbeck College in London.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1970</strong> - Discovers a remarkable property: by using quantum
          theory and general relativity he is able to show that black holes can emit
          radiation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1973</strong> - Joins the department of applied mathematics and
          theoretical physics at Cambridge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1973</strong> - Joins the department of applied mathematics and
          theoretical physics at Cambridge. In the same year he discovers, to his
          disbelief, that black holes could leak energy and particles into space, and
          even explode in a fountain of high-energy sparks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1974</strong> - His breakthrough discovery is published in the
          journal Nature, in a paper entitled Black hole Explosion?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1977</strong> - Appointed professor of gravitational physics at
          Cambridge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1979</strong> - Appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics at
          Cambridge (a chair held by Sir Isaac Newton in 1663). Elected as a fellow of
          the Royal Society.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1988</strong> - Publishes A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang
          to Black Holes, a classic introduction to today's most important scientific
          ideas about the cosmos. Recorded in the 1998 Guinness Book of Records as an
          all-time bestseller.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1998</strong> - Publishes Stephen Hawking's Universe: The Cosmos
          Explained, a book about the basis of our existence and of everything around
          us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2001</strong> - Releases Universe in a Nutshell in the UK, a book
          that unravels the mysteries of recent breakthroughs in physics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2002</strong> - Releases On the Shoulders of Giants, The Great Works
          of Physics and Astronomy, an exploration of some of the greatest visionaries
          in the history of science including Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton and
          Einstein. Publishes The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the
          Universe, a book that presents the most complex theories of physics past and
          present.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2004</strong> - Hawking announces that he has solved the Black Hole
          paradox, which has been a troubling scientists for years. He presents his
          most recent findings at the international conference on general relativity
          and gravitation in Dublin.
        </li>

        <hr>
        <li>
          <strong>1966 to 1975</strong> - Extended the singularity theorem concepts
          first explored in his doctoral thesis
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1975</strong> - He was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius
          XI Gold Medal
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1976</strong> - He was awarded to the Dannie Heineman Prize, the
          Maxwell Medal and Prize and the Hughes Medal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1978</strong> - He received the Albert Einstein Medal and an
          honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.

  <p>"Ever since the dawn of civilization, people have not been content to see events as unconnected and inexplicable. They have craved an understanding of the underlying order in the world. Today we still yearn to know why we are here and where we came from. Humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest. And our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in."<p/>
